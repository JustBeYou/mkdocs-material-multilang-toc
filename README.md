Mkdocs-material-multilang-toc
===

Currently, `mkdocs-material` does not support multilanguage ToC in a convenable manner so this plugin should add the missing feature. You need to have `mkdocs-material-insiders` added to your `requirements.txt` by using the following line:
```
git+https://{token}@github.com/{your user}/mkdocs-material-insiders@master
```
